# Salzman-Coding-Assignment-1

Here you fill find the map of where to look for answers to each individual part of the assignment, as well as some of the solutions themselves. Each code has been commented to explain to the reader what the code does and how it necessarily works. The tests themselves are not included with the files, but rather just the implementations of the solutions.

Part 1:

1.1 and 1.2: See Part-1.py file for implementations for caesar_cipher() and vigenere_cipher()


Part 2:

2.1: See 2.1-image.jpg file

2.2: See Part-2.py file for implementation of frequency-analysis()

2.3: The cross-correlation for Set 1 and Set 2 is 0.003098. The cross-correlation for Set 1 and Set 3 is 0.00254. Both of these values were calculated using the cross-correlation function as seen in the Part-2.py file

2.4 and 2.5: See Part-2.py file for implementation of get_caesar_shift() and get_vigenere_keyword()
