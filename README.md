# Salzman-Coding-Assignment-1
Both parts of the first coding assignment for CSC 348

Part 1:

1.1 and 1.2: See Part-1.py file for implementations for caesar_cipher() and vigenere_cipher()


Part 2:

2.1: See 2.1-Image file

2.2: See Part-2.py file for implementation of frequency-analysis

2.3: The cross-correlation for Set 1 and Set 2 is 0.003098. The cross-correlation for Set 1 and Set 3 is 0.00254. Both of these values were calculated using the cross-correlation function as seen in the Part-2.py file

2.4 and 2.5: See Part-2.py file for implementation of get_caesar_shift() and get_vigenere_keyword()
